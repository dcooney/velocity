# Velocity
**Velocity** is an alternative loading method to the standard to YouTube, Vimeo and Soundcloud iframe embeds. 

With Velocity you will decrease the loading time and increase overall performance of your website by lazy loading media on-demand instead of on initial page load.

**[See some examples](https://connekthq.com/plugins/velocity/)**
